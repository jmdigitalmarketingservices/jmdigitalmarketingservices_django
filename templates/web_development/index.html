                    <h2>Planning</h2>
                    <p>Before we embark on building your website we get a clear understanding of your conversion goals.
                        This helps us to plan the content and pages that will offer the right information to your
                        audience and help you achieve the best results from a user experience.</p>
                    <h2>Creating Content</h2>
                    <p>From UX to UI we use a no-compromise approach that creates good design and builds trust. With
                        more devices available to users it is important to create design that has a similar user
                        experience on all devices and is responsive to the screen width unique to each device. It is
                        important to ensure that content is consistent with your branding and is reflected on every page
                        of your website.</p>
                    <h2>Platforms</h2>
                    <p>We are comfortable with designing websites using different coding and programming languages. Most
                        websites today are designed using CMS and our experts are well-versed in using these methods to
                        create beautiful looking sites that have a great appeal and experience to the site visitor.</p>
                    <h2>Customization</h2>
                    <p>We integrate powerful technology that help clients work smarter and more efficiently. With the
                        help of 3rd party solutions, apps and plugins we can increase the functionality of your site and
                        offer a more powerful user experience. Customization makes it possible to have a lower bounce
                        rate and keep your user more engaged.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2>ECommerce</h2>
                    <p>An eCommerce website is an online portal that enables the online purchase of goods and services
                        without the need of having a brick-and-mortar store. We have built several eCommerce sites for
                        our clients using, CMS platforms like WooCommerce, WordPress, and Shopify.</p>
